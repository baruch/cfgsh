cfgsh 1.1.2

cfgsh, the Configation Shell utility, is a small utility meant to be use for
the configutation of embedded systems. The idea is that for embedded systems 
the 'normal' way of configuring a GBU/Linux host is simply non sentient -
the entire notion of an administrator that edits the system startup scripts
simply does not fit the notion of an embedded device that by definition is
supposed to function with little or no knowledgable person intervention.

cfgsh is meant to replace the normal combination of utilities such ifconfig,
route and friends, together with the startup scripts and configuration files
that use them with a single program and configuration file that will implment
the same functionality in a manner more consistent with the embedded system
world.

cfgsh is called once from the startup scripts with the special option 'setup'
to set up the state of the machine on boot from a text based configuration file
and hence forwards can be called either as a 'shell' from a serial or network
session to interactivly change the state of the system adn it's configuration
or in 'batch mode' from an executable or script (probably using the 'silent'
option) to change the system state and configuration in a programtic fashion.

The utility is built to be used in an embedded systems both from the point
of view of robustness (no matter what you that you cannot leave the system 
in a mangled state) and of security (it is built to run suid root with all
the implications of this potentially dangerous situation). The above should
*not* be taken as a to say it is free from bugs or design mistakes, only to
indicate that thought and care have gone to it's design and implmentation in
order to address these issues. 

If you're using cfgsh and find usefull (or not :-) I would very much like to
know about it and will be happy to recieve email to gilad@codefidence.com
telling me about how you're using cfgsh. The information will be kept 
confidential if you so prefer, but please make sure to indicate this in your 
email. Any bug reports, suggestions and most especially patches will be 
accepted with great joy! :-)

License
~~~~~~~

The cfgsh Configuration Shell utility is free software, distributed under 
the terms of the  [GNU] General Public License, version 2.  For more 
information, see the  file COPYING.

Usage
~~~~~

Usage: ./cfgsh [option]

Options:
  setup  - Setup system on boot from configuration file.
  clean  - Reset internal state to null values.
           Does not change the system state.
  silent - Work normally, but don't display prompt.
           Good for use from scripts:

	# echo -e "network\nip 10.0.0.1\n" | cfgsh silent

cfgsh will normally start in interactive mode. Type 'help' to get a full
list of comamnds. TAB and the '?' can be used in stage to get context 
sensative on-line help and command completion.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because cfgsh needs to be able to adjust system parameters, it must be run
as root. One way to let mere mortals to use cfgsh is to install the binary
suid root. This is of course a security risk, but the utility was designed
and written to mitigate the risks involved as much as possible.

To install cfgsh in this fashion, simply copy the binary to where you
want it to reside (/bin/ is a good place) and issue the following command
as root:

chown root.root /bin/cfgsh; chmod u=rsx,go=rx /bin/cfgsh

cfgsh will crate the system configuration file when you run it and issue
the "save" command from it's interactive menu. The file will be created at
/etc/system.conf

Also, cfgsh expects to find three scripts (or exeutables) at
/usr/sbin/run-dhcpc, /usr/sbin/stop-dhcpc and /usr/sbin/iponly-dhcpc 
that start and stop the DHCP protocol client. The assumption is that 
scripts will return after  the DHCP server has been found (and return 
an exit code of 0) or after the script has failed to locate an active 
DHCP server (and return an exit code of non zero).

Example for these scripts as well systemc config file is available
in the examples directory.

Special note regarding DHCP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that while dhcp is on AND an active DHCP server has been found
the 'ip',  'netmask', and 'broadcast' interface mode commands will 
only effect the static configuration but will NOT change the actual 
state of the system so as to not clobber the DHCP server dynamic 
settings. If you wish to change the actual state of the system, 
issue a 'dhcp off' command and then enter you changes.
